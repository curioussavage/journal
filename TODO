Items are not sorted in any way

* fix dates (store utc in db - or determine if this is really needed)
* consider breaking code out into modules
* cleanup unused deps (from earlier experiments)
* look into a better command line arg parser (docopt commandeer)
* get version from nimble file
* (high priority) support passing only month-day to edit date
